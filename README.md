# win_text_simple and the Win32-API

In chapter 2 of [1], the author describes and provides a code listing
for a simple text-based window. The example uses what was then known as the
Windows 95 API, which would later become the Win32-API.

Microsoft(R) Visual Studio(R) products (even Community-Editions)
still support the Win32-API. This API is very conventient
and can still be used to program Windows(R)-based applications.
